1) Frogger is an old platforming arcade game , the goal is to reach the end of the map by dodging the cars and jump on wood to pass a river we used the original
 as a reference but we add randomness like the random speed of the car and the wood and the distance between them. When you passed the finished line the level increment
 and the number of car increase and the number of wood you can pass on decrease (the difficulty level in genral increase).

3)You can control the Frog with W/A/S/D and when you use your 5 lives and you lost you have 3 seconde to press "space" to play again and lauch another game
